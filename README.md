A short arena game where you survive shooting angry goblins!
I used many yt tutorials to learn about hoe to make mob mechanics, collisions in game and used publiv top down shooter assets for the images!

WASD to move and use the cursor LMB to shoot! Its an endless wave game so see how long you survive

V1.4 -   Remodulated all the sprites, added a bullet mechanic and the mob killing animation!

V1.5 - cChanged the enemy sprites, bullet sprite to a new asset pack, made the tilemap and debugged A LOT!

V1.6 - Almost done, added a wave mechanic where the mobs ramp up as time passes and if even one touches you then you lose! Added a mob death animation!

V1.7 - Added a powerup mechanic, dead mobs drop a increased gun rate and extra health, now the map is endless so its a matter of how long you can survive!!
